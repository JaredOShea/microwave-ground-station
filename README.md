Senior Design Project - Microwave Ground Tracking Station for Dr. Rojas

## Product Vision 
We will design, fabricate, and demonstrate a prototype microwave ground station that tracks satellites and receives microwave communications. We will order a mount, positioner, antenna and integrate components with our software defined radio. This will include spacecraft orbit tracking algorithms, development of tracking software, integration of the positioning/receiver software, and the creation of a graphic user interface.

Added Contingencies: Upon purchasing the positioner, shipping will take 2-4 weeks to arrive. During this time, we will test our satellite tracking software with the previous MTGS team’s project. In the event we are unable to order our positioner or it arrives with broken or missing pieces, we will proceed with modifying the previous group’s hardware. During that event, our focus will be on implementation of our satellite tracking software.
